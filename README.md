+ Project summary: Given the dataset which contains label(spam or ham) and texts, we would like to discover the contextual tendency on the emails and build models which classify those two types. In order to achive those missions, we use wordcloud to observe the word frequency. We also use bigram to count the frequency of appearing word pairs as well as to find out the relation of those pairs by visualizing. After this procedure, we build models using Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM to predict whether a email is spam or not. Our dataset comes from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/vennaa/notebook-spam-text-message-classification-with-r/data?fbclid=IwAR2e2X_Wn0DayCoCRRfWiOaFxYZYVzFySDe7NL5NyjDAEPs2iLzSHtfJqXk)
